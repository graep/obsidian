#Prayer 

[[Psalms 62:8]] - [[Trust]] in him at all times, O people. Pour out your hearts before him. [[God]] is a refuge for us.

[[1 Peter 5:7]] - while you throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.

[[Luke 11:2]] - Father, let your name be [[sanctified]]. Let your [[kingdom]] come. Give us each day our daily bread according to our needs and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also [[forgive]] everyone who is in debt to us; and do not bring us into temptation. 

[[Matthew 6:9]] - You must pray then this way:

Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place as in heaven, also on earth. Give us today our bread for this day and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors. Do not bring us into temptation but deliver us from the wicked one. 

[[Psalms 65:2]] -  O hearer of prayer, to you people of all sorts will come.
